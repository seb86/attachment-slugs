## 🔔 Overview

**Attachment Slugs for WordPress** enables you to add permalink support for media attachments making the attachment URLs more friendly and great for SEO results should you decide to index your attachments. 

You can also edit the permalink slug of an individual attachment which you can not do via _Quick Edit_ like other post types. Changing the attachment title does not update the permalink slug so this handy to have should you want to rename the URL for the attachment.

## How to edit an attachment slug?

Simply go to the media library and edit the item you wish to rename. Then on the left side under "Attachment Slug" you can rename the slug. Press the "Update" button and that's it.
